   ```

2. **Run the Docker container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 medication-api
   ```

### Option 2: Deploy to Render

This project has been deployed to [Render](https://render.com), a cloud platform that supports easy deployment for Django projects. You can follow these steps to deploy to Render:

1. **Connect to GitHub**: Link your GitHub repository to Render.
2. **Create a New Web Service**: Select Django as the framework, and configure environment variables as needed.
3. **Set Up Build Commands**: Render will automatically detect Djangoâ€™s build and start commands, but you may need to adjust them for your specific requirements.

The deployment on Render offers a free hosting tier, which is ideal for testing and development purposes.
